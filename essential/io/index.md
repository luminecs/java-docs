# Lesson: Basic I/O

This lesson covers the Java platform classes used for basic I/O. It first focuses on I/O Streams, a powerful concept that greatly simplifies I/O operations. The lesson also looks at serialization, which lets a program write whole objects out to streams and read them back again. Then the lesson looks at file I/O and file system operations, including random access files.

Most of the classes covered in the `I/O Streams` section are in the `java.io` package. Most of the classes covered in the `File I/O` section are in the `java.nio.file` package.

## [I/O Streams]()

* [Byte Streams]() handle I/O of raw binary data.
* [Character Streams]() handle I/O of character data, automatically handling translation to and from the local character set.
* [Buffered Streams]() optimize input and output by <u>reducing the number of calls to the native API</u>.
